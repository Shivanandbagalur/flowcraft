# FlowCraft — Visual Chatbot Flow Builder

A node-based visual workflow engine for designing and simulating chatbot conversations.

FlowCraft enables users to build conversational logic using a drag-and-drop interface, eliminating the need for hardcoded chatbot logic. The system models conversations as a directed graph and executes them through dynamic traversal during preview.

## ⚙️ How It Works

FlowCraft represents chatbot conversations as a **directed graph**:

- **Nodes** → Represent conversational steps (message, input, condition)
- **Edges** → Define transitions between steps
- **Traversal Engine** → Executes nodes sequentially during preview

### Execution Flow:

1. Start from the **Start node**
2. Traverse connected nodes
3. Execute node-specific behavior:
   - Message → Display text
   - Input → Wait for user response
   - Condition → Choose next branch
4. Continue until **End node**

This approach separates UI design from execution logic, similar to real-world workflow engines.

## 🧠 Engineering Highlights

- Implemented a **graph-based execution engine** using adjacency relationships
- Designed a **modular component architecture** for scalability
- Built a **custom hook (`useFlow`)** to manage node/edge state cleanly
- Handled **dynamic traversal with user-driven state transitions**
- Optimized UI interactions for smooth drag-drop and real-time updates

## ✨ Features

### Flow Builder

- **Drag & Drop Canvas** — Drag node types from the sidebar onto the React Flow canvas
- **5 Node Types** — Start, Message, User Input, Condition, End — each visually distinct
- **Visual Connections** — Click and drag from any node handle to connect nodes
- **Delete Key Support** — Select a node or edge and press `Delete` to remove it

### Node Editing

- **Inline Editing** — Double-click any node text to edit it in place
- **Keyboard Shortcuts** — `Enter` to save, `Escape` to cancel
- **Per-node Delete** — Hover a node to reveal the delete button

### Preview / Simulation

- **Live Chatbot Preview** — Click "Run Preview" to simulate the conversation
- **Typing Indicators** — Realistic typing delay before bot messages appear
- **User Input Handling** — Input nodes pause the simulation and wait for user response
- **Condition Branches** — Auto-advances through the first available branch
- **Restart** — Restart the conversation at any time

### Save / Load

- **Export JSON** — Save your entire flow (nodes + edges) as `flow.json`
- **Import JSON** — Load a previously saved flow back onto the canvas
- **Reset** — Restore the built-in demo flow
- **Clear** — Empty the canvas to start fresh

### UI/UX

- Dark industrial aesthetic with color-coded node types
- MiniMap for navigating large flows
- Zoom controls and canvas panning
- Toast notifications for save/load feedback
- Stat panel showing node and edge counts

| Node           | Color  | Purpose                                |
| -------------- | ------ | -------------------------------------- |
| **Start**      | Teal   | Entry point — every flow must have one |
| **Message**    | Blue   | Bot sends a message to the user        |
| **User Input** | Green  | Pauses flow and collects user response |
| **Condition**  | Purple | Branch logic (yes/no paths)            |
| **End**        | Red    | Terminates the conversation            |
